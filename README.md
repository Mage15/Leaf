# Leaf 0.5

As I continued to work on what used to be my MonogameUI project I quickly realized that the direction the project was headed was not going to have the efficiency required by a video game.
I began to strip out a lot of the features in order to make MonogameUI usable for gaming. As I was doing this I thought "Why not split MonogameUI in two?" Each with it's own focus. Hence Leaf was born.

The goal with Leaf will be to build a web browser from scratch using the .NET framework.

Currently Leaf is still under heavy development and is not recommended for use.


## Roadmap
